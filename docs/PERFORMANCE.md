# Performance and Benchmarking

## Benchmark Scope

`chunkdb` benchmarks are designed to characterize behavior under the engine's own workload model:
- chunk/grid-oriented data layout
- point block updates/lookups
- full-chunk reads (text and binary)
- fixed-width bit-packed block payloads
- explicit durability mode context

This suite is intended for transparency and reproducibility of `chunkdb` behavior, not for broad winner/loser rankings across unrelated database categories.

## Benchmark Executables

1. Direct storage API benchmark: `chunkdb_bench`
2. End-to-end server-path benchmark: `chunkdb_server_bench`

## Direct Storage Benchmark (`chunkdb_bench`)

Scenarios:
- point writes
- point reads
- hot chunk writes
- chunk reads (text)
- chunk reads (binary)
- mixed read/write (70/30)
- sparse world writes
- dense world writes
- cold start reads
- warm cache reads

Run:

```bash
./build/chunkdb_bench --ops 20000
```

## Server-Path Benchmark (`chunkdb_server_bench`)

Scenarios:
- protocol `PING`
- protocol `INFO`
- protocol `SET`
- protocol `GET`
- protocol `CHUNK` (text payload)
- protocol `CHUNKBIN` (binary payload)
- protocol mixed read/write (70/30)

Run:

```bash
./build/chunkdb_server_bench --ops 5000 --port 4242
```

## Reproducible Benchmark Artifacts

Use the reproducibility script to generate a benchmark bundle with:
- exact git revision
- build/test logs
- host metadata
- benchmark outputs

Run locally:

```bash
scripts/bench/run_reproducible_benchmarks.sh
```

Artifact layout is documented in:
- [bench/artifacts/README.md](../bench/artifacts/README.md)

GitHub workflow support:
- `.github/workflows/benchmark-artifacts.yml`
- triggers:
  - manual (`workflow_dispatch`)
  - automatically on release publish

The workflow uploads a downloadable artifact bundle for verification/review.

## What These Benchmarks Measure

- request/operation latency and throughput for implemented chunk workloads
- relative cost differences between text and binary chunk transfer
- cold-vs-warm behavior (direct API suite)
- runtime overhead for full TCP/protocol path (server-path suite)
- server command latency percentiles (p50/p95/p99) for each measured scenario

## What These Benchmarks Do Not Measure

- replication/distributed behavior
- full transactional semantics across chunks
- full power-loss validation across all filesystems/devices
- all multi-client saturation patterns
- every production fault model

## Optional Cross-System Study Policy

If a cross-system comparison is published (for example against PostgreSQL/Redis), it should:
1. define exact schema/workload mapping
2. match durability assumptions explicitly
3. include complete reproducible commands/scripts
4. keep conclusions scoped to tested scenarios only

Absent those controls, benchmark output should be treated as `chunkdb`-only behavior characterization.
